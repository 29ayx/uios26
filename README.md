# UI OS 26

A minimal showcase of glass-morphism UI components—Card, Button, and Navbar—built with **Next.js (App Router + TypeScript)** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
Visual style takes cues from the latest **iOS** translucency (blurred frosted glass) and the classic **Windows Vista** Aero interface.

---

## Features

• Fully responsive, dark-mode first design with a one-click light toggle  
• Glass components with edge bleeding, inner/outer shadows, and interactive "shine" animation  
• Background sky illustration for a bright test-bed  
• Clean, type-safe React components with the App Router file structure  
• Zero config—just `npm install && npm run dev`

---

## Getting Started

```bash
# install deps
yarn        # or npm install / pnpm i / bun i

# run locally
yarn dev    # then open http://localhost:3000
```
